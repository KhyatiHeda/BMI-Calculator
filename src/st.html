    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #000"> SEVERE THINNESS</h1>
    <p> Your bmi calculator shows: Severe thinness!! </p>
    <p>Being underweight has its own associated risks, listed below:

        Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, anemia (lowered ability to carry blood vessels)
        Osteoporosis, a disease that causes bone weakness, increasing the risk of breaking a bone
        A decrease in immune function
        Growth and development issues, particularly in children and teenagers
        Possible reproductive issues for women due to hormonal imbalances that can disrupt the menstrual cycle. Underweight women also have a higher chance of miscarriage in the first trimester
        Potential complications as a result of surgery
        Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI
        In some cases, being underweight can be a sign of some underlying condition or disease such as anorexia nervosa, which has its own risks. Consult your doctor if you think you or someone you know is underweight, particularly if the reason for being underweight does not seem obvious.</p>

    <p class="diet"> DOCTORS RECOMMENDED: </p>
    <p class="diet">Choose nutrient-rich foods. As part of an overall healthy diet, choose whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals; fruits and vegetables; dairy products; lean protein sources; and nuts and seeds.
        Try smoothies and shakes. Don't fill up on diet soda, coffee and other drinks with few calories and little nutritional value. Instead, drink smoothies or healthy shakes made with milk and fresh or frozen juice, and sprinkle in some ground flaxseed.</p>
